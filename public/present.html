		<blockquote>
		<p>Frameworks tend to lean in either of 2 directions 1) Convention over configuration 2) Fully customizable but require large amount of architectural decisions After using a large amount of frameworks for both work and pleasure, finding Lithium which contains a healthy balance of default conventions but having true freedom to customize and configure your project both within the framework boundaries and by bending them makes this tool one of the most developer happy framework tools to use.

		<blockquote>
		<p>Come learn about a new PHP Framework that some are touting as a potential game changer for PHP. If you are using any of the popular PHP frameworks like CakePHP, Symfony, Zend, or CodeIgniter - then you owe it to yourself to check out what Lithium has to offer... Lithium is a framework for PHP 5.3+ that is focused on quality, speed, and flexibility. It's a set of no-nonsense philosophies and tools that enable you to build better applications, in less time, without sacrificing quality or extensibility. Lithium understands distributed storage and caching, queuing systems, micro-dispatch frameworks, with integrated support for document oriented databases like CouchDB and MongoDB, alongside relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL. Lithium's architecture allows you to get your application up and running quickly, and still allows you to take control of the framework to support the requirements of your application. This presentation will be presented by Nate Abele who is the co-founder of Lithium framework. Prior to this, he was the lead developer of the very popular Cake PHP framework. Nate has been a member of Boston PHP for a long time, and we are really excited to have him come talk about Lithium.
		"The Zen of Lithium" provides an overview of some of the philosophies behind the Lithium framework.</p>

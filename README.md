# The official liâ‚ƒ Site

## Synopsis

This is the repository for the main li3 site. Its goal is to provide
a fresh, modern and lean web entity that makes content around li3 easy
to discover.

It serves the naked DOMAIN. A MySQL database is needed to run the site.

## Development

Currently only Linux and Darwin are supported as deployment and developing
platforms. It is expected that you are running ningx with php-fpm.

To initialize the project for development run the following commands. You
have to run these only once. After running `make install` verify the deta
configuration created for your local development environment.

```
$ make install
$ $EDITOR config/deta/dev.conf
$ cd bin
$ ./deta -c ../config/deta create-config.sh
```

Add the following entry to `/etc/hosts`:
``` 
127.0.0.1 lithium-site.dev
```

Include the generated nginx configuration file in you main nginx.conf and 
restart the server afterwards.
``` 
include /path/to/lithium_site/config/nginx/servers/*.conf;
```

Now the site should be available under [lithium-site.dev](http://lithium-site.dev).

### Updating Dependencies 

PHP dependencies are managed via composer:
```
$ cd app
$ composer update
```

This repository is based off UnionOfRAD/framework. To bring in updates 
fetch from the remote, then merge (no rebase) into our master.

### Assets

Assets are contained in the `assets` directory in the root of the project. That
directory is made accessible via `DOMAIN/assets`. 

Assets within plugins are not used, instead all assets needed by the site and 
its plugins should be placed into `DOMAIN/assets` and name accordingly.

```
css/u1m.css - Base styles used on any entity in the li3 universe.
css/site.css - Contains styles relevant to the site only.
css/li3_bot.css  - Contains styles when using the bot plugin.
css/highlight.css - Extra styles that can be loaded if needed.
```

Use the body class to namespace styles to plugins. The body classes will be
`site`, `li3-bot`, `li3-docs` respectively.

Use public CDN's for JavaScript resources if possible.

### Layouts & Plugin Content

All plugins views are rendered within the main app's layout. 
Do not use the the plugin's layout.  

### Running other Tasks

application and reaching as far as deploying the whole project. These tasks
can be listed and executed as follows. Tasks are based on [deta](https://github.com/davidpersson/deta), for more

			li3 is not just a framework, but the embodiment of a community. This
			community is dedicated to open collaboration and friendly discourse, with
			the goal of producing better quality software.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most importantly, you are invited to <em>participate</em>. As with any
			communities there are some rules and conventions. In order for everyone
			to have a productive and positive experience, we ask that every member
			familiarizes themselves with the <a href="#guidelines">guidelines</a> below. We do not want to have
			to tell you what would happen if the guidelines are not followed. ;-)

			<h2 class="h-gamma">Respect</h2>
			<p>
				We all have day jobs, but we also enjoying helping others. <em>Respect each
				other's time and ideas</em>. Try to give back more than you take.
			</p>
			<h2 class="h-gamma">Friendliness</h2>
			<p>
				Keeping a healthy attitude and friendly atmosphere will make the experience
				enjoyable for all and will make sure that the people who are willing to
				spend time helping others are not driven away.
			</p>
			<h2 class="h-gamma">Focus</h2>
			<p>
				Staying on topic will make sure that the discussion remains fruitful for
				everyone and reduces the effort of finding useful information.
			</p>
			<h2 class="h-gamma">Questions</h2>
			<p>
				Be in the right place and direct questions at the group. Everyone is here
				to help, so only talk to an individual when you have already engaged them
				in the conversation. Private messages should only be used as a last resort.
